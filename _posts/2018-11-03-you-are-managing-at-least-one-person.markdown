You are continuously managing one person. You manage their time, energy, motivation and frustration.

This is the team you manage:

Yourself.

Are you a good manager to yourself?

How do you want your team to perform?

How do you want your team to feel?

How do you want your team to make others feel?

Do you have your team stressed?

You are your own manager. You manage your time. You manage your energy. It is your responsibility.

Do you think you would be a better manager to yourself if you learned how to effectively manage time and energy?

What can you do to get better at it?
