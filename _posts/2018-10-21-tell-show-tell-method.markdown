Since I learned about the Tell-Show-Tell method, I've used it almost every day at work. It's a recipe to articulate explanations successfully that involves showing the usage of a product. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and effectiveness.

Steps:

1. **Tell**. Explain what you're going to demonstrate.

2. **Show**. Show the flow of the product visually.

3. **Tell**. Restate what you just showed and deliver its value or benefit, so that it's clear why the listener should care.

This technique is explained with great detail in the book *[Demonstrating To Win!](https://www.amazon.com/Demonstrating-Win-Indespensible-Complex-Products/dp/0615477097)* by [Bob Riefstahl](https://twitter.com/bobriefstahl), among many other useful tricks on how to demonstrate complex software solutions. Thanks to [Will Foley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-foley-73b18213/), a coworker of mine at [Splash](https://splashthat.com/), for recommending it to me.

I love using this technique on other contexts, besides demonstrating software products, like teaching or explaining ideas. Beginning to use this technique can be as simple as starting with "*I'm going to explain you \[idea\]*" and finishing with "*Now you know about \[idea\] and it's important because \[value\]*".
