*This is an adaptation of a 15-minute presentation I gave at Splash's monthly Management Lunch & Learn.*

I'm not an expert on growth processes for direct reports, but as I prepared this talk, I have 4 years of experience doing it. I've had a good amount of learned lessons that make me confident enough to share my thoughts on this topic.

Painting is the analogy I chose, because personal and professional growth feels to me like painting a living self-portrait, from broad strokes to small details, evolving the composition over time with new learnings, experiences, interests and goals.

# What is growth?

Growth can take many shapes:

* Development of professional (and personal) skills

* Acquisition of new knowledge

* Preparation for new responsibilities and opportunities

* Increase of value as a professional (compensation, recognition)

* Achievement of tangible goals (promotions)

* Development of self-awareness about one’s career

## Why does it matter?

* Organization with growth business goals always needs team members better equipped to solve problems.

* Many team members seek to see progress in their growth, their professional trajectory (source of demotivation when missing).

* Many team members feel fulfilled when they see progress in their growth, their professional trajectory (source of motivation when present).

# What’s my story? 🙋🏻

* I started my path as a manager VERY motivated by helping other team members grow in their careers.

* In my first years, I put a lot of work on this. This motivation enabled me to spend ridiculous amounts of hours listening to podcasts and reading books, crafting deep performance reviews, etc.

* Over time, my focus shifted to team performance & results. I accidentally left coaching and growth on the side.

* Upwards feedback helped me identify what I had left behind.

* Some reports were making me responsible for their (lack of) growth.

* Many people that seek growth don’t know how to get it or track it, but they can see their lack of progress.

## What did I do about it? 🤔

* Make a goal for me to create a baseline process to grow my direct reports. Not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a starting point.

* When taking new direct reports, I could listen to what their motivation was and their preference, and tell them about my process as a starting point.

# The framework

![short-mid-long-term.png](/uploads/short-mid-long-term.png)

## 1. Short Term

![short.png](/uploads/short.png)

Feedback, educational discussions during 1:1s, reflection opportunities.

> Feedback examples:
>
> When you respond to a blocker incident, you keep stakeholders updated every few minutes, and that’s very helpful for them to keep customers feeling we’re in control.
>
> When you respond to a blocker incident, you take a few minutes to give signals in the #outages channel after acknowledging the alert, and during this time all stakeholders are uncomfortably wondering what’s happening. Can we count on you giving an update right away when you respond to the alert?

## 2. Mid Term

Coaching processes. Identify an area of improvement/focus, brainstorm resources and approaches to improve, define goals, review in 1:1s.

> Examples:
>
> Improve my collaboration with Product Design.
>
> Improve presentation skills.

## 3. Long Term

Career vision.\
Write a document, or discuss is in person (and take shared notes).\
Develop an understanding of your report’s long term vision for themselves, or help them develop one.

> Examples:
>
> I want to be an engineer with expertise in microservice architectures.
>
> I want to have had experience in various roles and areas of focus.
>
> I want a great work/life balance, with a fulfilling, stable job and ability to focus my energy in my family.

## Feedback loop

![feedback-loop.png](/uploads/feedback-loop.png)

Defining areas of growth informs short term opportunities and areas of focus on the feedback. Defining a career plan also informs short term opportunities and areas of focus on the feedback.

## A rule for my direct reports

Your growth is your responsibility, not your manager’s.

Your manager has to:

* Retain you.

* Grow you in the way the business needs.

* Treat you fairly and with equal opportunity.

If you want to grow, you can hold your manager accountable for supporting you, having growth conversations, giving you pointed feedback, and identifying opportunities that align with your goals. But not for doing the homework of figuring out your career path for yourself, nor be the only source of opportunities that align with your goals.

# So how’s this working out?

![working-out.png](/uploads/working-out.png)

* Reception was good initially, and continues to be good.

* But not everybody wants to define a long term vision, that’s okay.

* But not everybody comes up of growth areas on their own (and if I pressure them to, they’ll do it, but they might not really own them). Then, it’s okay to be transparent about needing to set growth areas that are relevant for the business.

And so, the story will continue.
