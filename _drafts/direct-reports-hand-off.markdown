This post explains how I've handed off direct reports to other managers in the last year.

Changing the reporting structure can be stressful, especially for the direct report. Their new manager has to catch up quickly with their career goals and process. I've changed manager 4 times, and I've wondered each time questions like "What will happen to me with this new manager? Will they value my work? Will they challenge me to grow? Will I be unhappy and want to leave? Will they exit me?"

The **clearer** and **more inclusive** the hand-off process is, the less **uncertainty** and **stress** will creep in.

Inspired by [Lara Hogan's 1:1:1 manager hand-off](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-handoffs/), I've handled reporting hand-offs in the following way:

1. It's made clear to the direct report that their manager will change, and why.

2. I wrote a document giving context about their direct report in the organization, their performance history, their career goals.

3. The document is shared with the new manager, along with the last performance review.

4. I schedule a 1:1:1 meeting with the new manager and the direct report.

5. During the meeting, I go over the information in the document, giving opportunity for the direct report to clarify anything and the new manager to ask questions to the direct report. At the end of the meeting, the new manager and the direct report can discuss next steps, like scheduling their 1:1.

6. I schedule a follow-up with the direct report 1 month later, to check how things are going and get some feedback that could be useful to the new manager.

When a report was transferred to a very different team in terms of technology or team culture, direct reports felt more uncertain and stressed. Therefore, I needed to make more emphasis on the change being a safe one, and the new manager being there to support them and their onboarding.

Even with this clarity, a new manager <> report relationship should continue on the right track. And for that, doing a mutual expectation setting exercise is very helpful. Thanks to [Adrià Vallès](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriavalles/) for having showing me that!
