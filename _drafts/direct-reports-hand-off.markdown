This post explains how I've handed off direct reports to other managers in the last year.

Changing the reporting structure can be stressful, especially for the direct report. Their new manager has to catch up quickly with their career goals and process. Over the years, I've changed manager 4 times, and I've wondered each time questions like "What will happen to me with this new manager? Will they value my work? Will they challenge me to grow? Will I be unhappy and want to leave? Will they exit me?"

While a bit of uncertainty, concern and excitement are inevitable, we can *manage* it to reduce the negative emotions. The **clearer** and **more transparent** the hand-off process is, the less **uncertainty** and **stress** will creep in.

Inspired by [Lara Hogan's 1:1:1 manager hand-off](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-handoffs/), I've handled reporting hand-offs in the following way:

1. **Communication**. I communicate the upcoming change and the plan to the direct report, and why I think it's a good idea or necessary.

2. **Writing**. I spend some time writing a document about the direct report in the organization, their performance history, their career goals. I share that document, along with the last performance review, with the upcoming manager. They should have some days to review ahead of the meeting.

3. **Hand-off Meeting**. I schedule a 1:1:1 meeting with the upcoming manager, the direct report, and me. During the meeting, I go over the information in the document, giving opportunity for the direct report to clarify anything, and for the new manager to ask questions to the direct report. At the end of the meeting, the new manager and the direct report can discuss next steps, like scheduling their 1:1.

4. **Follow-up**. I schedule a follow-up with the direct report 1 month later, to check how things are going and get some feedback that could be useful to the new manager.

The bigger the change, the more the reports feel stressed and unsafe. I saw this when transferring reports to teams with different technology skill set or cultural norms. Therefore, I needed to make more emphasis on the change being a safe one, and the new manager being there to support them and their onboarding.

Sometimes, a complicated situation requires swift action, a manager unexpectedly left, or some other situation makes it not possible to do a smooth hand-off. When that happens, I try to compensate for that however I can.

Finally, a new manager <> report relationship should continue on the right track. Doing a mutual expectation setting exercise is very helpful. Thanks to [Adrià Vallès](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriavalles/) for having showed me that!
