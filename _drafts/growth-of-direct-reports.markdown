I've had a good amount of learned lessons with growth of direct reports. I'm not an expert, but I feel confident enough to share my thoughts on this topic.

Personal and professional growth feel to me like painting a living self-portrait. From broad strokes to small details, one evolves the composition over time with new learnings, experiences, interests and goals. That's why I chose the analogy of painting for this talk.

# What is growth?

Growth can take many shapes:

* Development of professional (and personal) skills

* Acquisition of new knowledge

* Preparation for new responsibilities and opportunities

* Increase of value as a professional (compensation, recognition)

* Achievement of tangible goals (promotions)

* Development of self-awareness about one’s career

## Why does it matter?

* Organization with growth business goals always needs their team members to be better equipped to solve problems.

* Many team members want to see progress in their growth, in their professional trajectory. It can be  a source of demotivation when missing.

* Many team members feel fulfilled when they see progress in their growth, in their professional trajectory. It can be a source of motivation when present.

# What’s my story? 🙋🏻

I started my manager path VERY motivated by helping other team members grow in their careers. In my first years, I put a lot of work into this. This motivation enabled me to spend ridiculous amounts of hours learning about this topic, listening to podcasts, reading books, crafting deep performance reviews, etc.

Over time, my focus shifted to team performance and results. I accidentally left the priority of coaching and growing direct reports on the side.

Later, upwards feedback helped me identify what I had left behind. Also, some reports were making me responsible for their (lack of) growth. I learned that some people that voice wanting growth don’t know how to get it, how to track it themselves, or even in which direction to grow. But they can clearly see their lack of progress, and that can be demotivating.

## What did I do about it? 🤔

I made a goal for myself to create a baseline framework to grow my direct reports. Not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a starting point. My idea was that, when taking new direct reports, I could listen to what their motivations were and their preference in how they wanted me to coach them, and share my process as a starting point.

# The framework

## 1. Short Term

Feedback, educational discussions during 1:1s, reflection opportunities.

> Feedback examples:
>
> When you respond to a blocker incident, you keep stakeholders updated every few minutes, and that’s very helpful for them to keep customers feeling we’re in control.
>
> When you respond to a blocker incident, you take a few minutes to give signals in the #outages channel after acknowledging the alert, and during this time all stakeholders are uncomfortably wondering what’s happening. Can we count on you giving an update right away when you respond to the alert?

## 2. Mid Term

Coaching processes. Identify an area of improvement/focus, brainstorm resources and approaches to improve, define goals, review in 1:1s.

> Examples:
>
> Improve my collaboration with Product Design.
>
> Improve presentation skills.

## 3. Long Term

Career vision.\
Write a document, or discuss is in person (and take shared notes).\
Develop an understanding of your report’s long term vision for themselves, or help them develop one.

> Examples:
>
> I want to be an engineer with expertise in microservice architectures.
>
> I want to have had experience in various roles and areas of focus.
>
> I want a great work/life balance, with a fulfilling, stable job and ability to focus my energy in my family.

## Feedback loop

![feedback-loop.png](/uploads/feedback-loop.png)

Defining areas of growth informs short term opportunities and areas of focus on the feedback. Defining a career plan also informs short term opportunities and areas of focus on the feedback.

## A rule for my direct reports

Your growth is your responsibility, not your manager’s.

Your manager has to:

* Retain you.

* Grow you in the way the business needs.

* Treat you fairly and with equal opportunity.

If you want to grow, you can hold your manager accountable for supporting you, having growth conversations, giving you pointed feedback, and identifying opportunities that align with your goals. But not for doing the homework of figuring out your career path for yourself, nor be the only source of opportunities that align with your goals.

# So how’s this working out?

![working-out.png](/uploads/working-out.png)

* Reception was good initially, and continues to be good.

* But not everybody wants to define a long term vision, that’s okay.

* But not everybody comes up of growth areas on their own (and if I pressure them to, they’ll do it, but they might not really own them). Then, it’s okay to be transparent about needing to set growth areas that are relevant for the business.

And so, the story will continue.
