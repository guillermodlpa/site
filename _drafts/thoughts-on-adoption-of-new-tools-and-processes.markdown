Have you ever feel frustrated that a process or tool you rolled out didn't get adoption? I surely have. It's easy to feel resentment towards the people that don't follow your instructions, don't use the tool you prepared for them, or don't comply with the process.

The attitude of blaming others for lack of adoption is unproductive. Like in effective communication, in reality 50% of the responsibility is on the speaker, and 50% on the listener. But the productive way to think about it, in when you're the speaker, is to think that 100% of responsibility is on you. That's the mindset that makes you own fully your part of it, think more critically, and consider more scenarios. Therefore, as a manager, you should think that you're 100% responsible for adoption.

It's ineffective to just put some great instructions and an email out there, and let the people do the rest. As the person rolling out a change, you have to measure and make sure. I set metrics ahead of time to measure success, and reminders to check them later.

When adoption isn't as good as you expected, avoid defaulting to blaming others for being irresponsible or bad listeners. You should take ownership of the lack of adoption. What's not working out? Was it not as clear as you thought it was? Are people in your organization not used to reading written communications in depth? How could you say things differently to reach your audience and embrace a change? Was this just the wrong time due to other factors?

Of course, it makes it easier to build a company culture in which rolling out changes and adhering to them is normal. The more expected it is by each other, the stronger the adherence will be.
