Have you ever feel frustrated that a  process or tool you rolled out didn't get adoption? I surely have. I'd ask myself, "*Why the heck isn't the team doing that important thing I asked them to do?*"

I'm fortunate to have had many examples to learn from, like adherence to defect SLOs, usage of APM tools, delegation in on-call rotations, and meeting facilitation. As a first-line manager, and later as product engineering leadership at Splash, I've rolled out numerous tools and policies. Some of them were badly received and poorly adopted. What was I doing wrong?

The right mindset: I'm fully responsible

The attitude of blaming others for lack of adoption is unproductive. It's like communication. Even though it isn't true, one has to feel responsible for 100% of it. That's the mindset that makes us think more critically. *What could I do differently to achieve better results? What am I not aware of that's causing friction to adopt this change?*

For example, it's ineffective to just write down instructions and send an email, assuming people will comply. That's just a great way to become a leader that asks for seemingly random things. The team will get used to receiving those orders, complying with them for a bit if at all, and dropping them later. They'll think, *probably they weren't that important in the first place*.

My tips

With the mindset of being fully responsible for the (lack of) adoption of a change, these are the things that help me:

* Ask myself if this is worth it, and if this is the right time.

* If it needs a long explanation, I write a change rollout document.

* I try to explain clearly the Why. What's the ultimate goal we're trying to achieve? What problem are we solving? I'll admin that identifying and articulating the actual reason for a change to a new tool or process isn't straightforward, even when it's my own idea. In that process of writing it down, I sometimes realize there's a better approach to solve the problem.

* Getting buy-in from the relevant stakeholders, listen to their feedback and incorporate it early on.

* Informing of the change in multiple channels (email, meetings, chats, etc.).

* Creating ways to easily measure adoption, like dashboards, and being transparent about the fact that I'll be using them.

* Evaluating adoption later, by setting myself reminders to check it.

* When I see lower adoption than expected, or lower success to fulfill the goal, I ask questions  to understand what would have to be true for adoption to be higher.

My advice to fellow managers is, when adoption isn't as good as they expected, to avoid defaulting to blaming others for being irresponsible or bad listeners. Take ownership of the lack of adoption. What's not working out? Was it not as clear as you thought it was? Are people in your organization not used to reading written communications in depth? How could you say things differently to reach your audience and embrace a change? Was this just the wrong time due to other factors? Has your change not hooked up to their pre-existing routines?

Company culture helps a lot

Of course, it makes it easier to build a company culture in which rolling out changes and adhering to them is normal. The more expected it is by each other, the stronger the adherence will be.

Conclusion

Own the adoption results fully. Make others accountable, but you're responsible.
