Hello there, I'm Guillermo de la Puente, a **software engineer** and **engineering manager.**
I focus the most on **frontend technologies**, like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), to create high quality web products.

My tech journey started with telecom engineering, becoming passionate about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I worked for a growing startup in New York, and a few years later moved to Madrid [to create an international office.](/blog/podcast-building-a-team-from-scratch-with-splash)
After 8 years, I decided to become self-employed, a digital nomad, and a resourceful and effective contractor. Check out my past work experience in [my portfolio.](/portfolio)

**I take pride on my work. I want to build high quality web products that create value, and I don't settle for less.**

If you'd like to find out more about how I work and my process of working with clients, please
get in touch and share a little information about the project you have in mind.
