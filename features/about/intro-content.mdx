Hello there, I'm Guillermo de la Puente, a **software engineer** and **product-minded tech leader** with a passion for building high-quality web products that solve real problems.

I specialize in **React**, **Node** and **AI** technologies, and over the years I’ve been a developer, tech lead, [team manager](/blog/category/management), contractor, and founder.

After falling in love with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I joined a **fast-growing startup** in New York, and later opened and lead its [international office in Madrid](/blog/podcast-building-a-team-from-scratch-with-splash). After 8 years, I chose to go independent, exploring new projects, [working remotely](/blog/category/digital+nomad), and sharpening my product and technical skills as a **freelancer** and **co-founder**.

Now I'm back to **building teams** and **driving product strategy.** I care deeply about creating thoughtful, effective work environments and helping engineers do their best work. I still **write code every day,** but I'm just as focused on the **people**, **processes**, and **decisions** that make a product truly valuable.

In my spare time, I debug TypeScript and Japanese grammar (日本語の文法).

Curious what I’ve built? Check out my [portfolio](/work), or [get in touch](/contact) if you’d like to collaborate.
