# Freelance Frontend Engineer & Manager

Hi there, I'm Guillermo de la Puente, a **frontend engineer** and engineering manager from Spain.

After a long journey that took me from studying telecom engineering to becoming passionate about web technologies and working for 8 years
at a NY-based tech startup as both engineer and manager, I decided to become self-employed and develop expertise in producing **successful, fast,
high quality web applications**.

If you'd like to find out more about how I work and my process of working with clients, please
get in touch and share a little information about the project you have in mind.
