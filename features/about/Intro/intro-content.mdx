# Freelance Frontend Engineer & Manager

Hello there, I'm Guillermo de la Puente, a **frontend engineer** and **engineering manager.**

My tech journey started with telecom engineering, becoming passionate about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I worked for a growing startup in New York, and a few years later moved to Madrid to create an international office.
After 8 years, I decided to become self-employed, a digital nomad, and become a resourceful and effective contractor.

**I take pride on my work. I want to build high quality web products that create value, and I don't settle for less.**

If you'd like to find out more about how I work and my process of working with clients, please
get in touch and share a little information about the project you have in mind.
