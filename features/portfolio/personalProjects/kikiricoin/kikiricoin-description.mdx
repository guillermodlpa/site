KikiriCoin (KIKI) is an ERC-20 token deployed on the Polygon blockchain
network. Its implementation is open source and meant to be educational
and fun

With this pet project, I learned the basics of **smart contracts**, the **solidity** programming language, and **web3**. The
website offers a faucet that, once connected to a wallet, can dispense KIKI tokens.
