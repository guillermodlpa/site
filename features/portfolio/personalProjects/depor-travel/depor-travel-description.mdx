depor.travel is an aggregator of sport trips around the world focused on
users in Spain.

We started building a squeeze page to capture emails of interested
users, built with Next.js and capturing data via Google Sheets with a
custom Apps Script API.

The initial prototype to test market fit was built with Webflow, which
combined with [Attributes](https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/),
it included all functionality necessary for an MVP.
