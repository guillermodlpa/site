**Notion** is a project management and note-taking software platform. Since
they launched their API, it can be used as a database for rich text
documents, and so it's a backend for a blog.

Leveraging Next.js **Static-Site-Generation**, the site retrieves all blog posts at build time and prepares
the blog summary and each blog post page. Combined with Next.js prefetching, they load instantly. The [sitemap](https://guillermodlpa.com/sitemap.xml) is also automatically generated.

My [custom renderer](https://github.com/guillermodlpa/site/tree/main/features/blogPost/NotionPageRenderer) renders each Notion block using Chakra UI components, the library of choice here, and compensates the limitations that the Notion API has.
