Notion is a project management and note-taking software platform. Since
they launched their API, it can be used as a database for rich text
documents, and so it's a backend for a blog.

With Next.js Static-Site-Generation, we just need to pull the blog posts
from the Notion API at build time, build the sitemap, and then make a
renderer to display the post as we want.
