With 2 other non-technical cofounders, we built Quatro as a web application
for managing tasks and scheduling them. It included a **drag and drop** task list, **calendar display**, repeating tasks,
an **integration with Google Calendar**, **desktop notifications**, plenty of keyboard shortcuts,
and a **native desktop app** using [ToDesktop.](https://www.todesktop.com/)

The project is currently abandoned. Its code is open sourced for others to learn from.
