With 2 other non-technical cofounders, we built Quatro as a web application
for managing tasks and scheduling them, with a
**calendar display**, repeating tasks, an
**integration with Google Calendar**,
**desktop notifications**, plenty of keyboard shortcuts, and a
**native desktop app** using [ToDesktop.](https://www.todesktop.com/)

The project is currently abandoned and its code left open source for others to
learn from.
