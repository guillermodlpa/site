After is an online memorials platform. Its frontend not only needs to be easy to use and fast,
but it needs to be smooth and delightful enough to evoke nostalgia and positive feelings.

I took on the project to **stabilize the product**, since at that time it had a lot of issues, and
to **increase user adoption**.
