The MVP was initially developed by an offshore agency. While they
created very nice designs, there were a number of problems resulting in
a poor quality product: bugs, UX issues, poor code quality, bad SEO, and
lack of basic accessibility. Users tried it a bit, but didn't
stick.

I took on the project to increase user adoption. That included
**fixing outstanding issues, improving the UX, and improving performance and SEO**.
As part of that, I migrated the frontend codebase to
**TypeScript**, which helped reduce bugs and ship with
continuous delivery with more confidence. With a very data-driven
approach measuring user traffic, I continued adding features, like the
**email nurture sequence with Sendinblue**, and simplifying
the way users collaborate on memorials to increase the metric of new
users per week.
