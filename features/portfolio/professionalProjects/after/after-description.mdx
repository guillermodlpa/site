After is an online memorials platform. Its frontend not only needs to be easy to use and fast,
but it needs to be smooth and delightful enough to evoke nostalgia and positive feelings.

I took on the project to **stabilize the product**, since at that time it had a lot of issues, and
to **increase user adoption**.

- Fix all outstanding issues
- Improve the user experience
- Simplify user flows to prevent users dropping off and boost sign-ups
- Implement email nurture sequences to encourage users to come back
- Implement SEO on all pages and monitor it via Google Search Console
- Migrate the codebase to TypeScript to eliminate type issues and deliver more quickly with confidence
