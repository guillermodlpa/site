depor.travel is an aggregator of sport trips around the world. We started focused on
users in Spain.

The project started with a static squeeze page to capture emails of interested
users, built with Next.js and deployed in Vercel to take advantage of their free tier, and capturing data via **Google Sheets with a
custom Apps Script API.**

The initial prototype to test product-market fit was built with **Webflow**. Combining it with [Attributes](https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/) for advanced filtering,
it included all functionality necessary for an MVP. I'm an advocate for not over-engineering solutions or building complex codebases when implementing prototypes.
