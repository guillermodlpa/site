Rossa is a management software product for hotels from a company based in Soria, Spain. Rossa's clients had been asking for a interactive calendar view to manage bookings across their rooms and properties, similar to the interface Airbnb offers with its advanced hosting controls.

I was hired through [Malt](https://www.malt.es/profile/guillermodelapuente) to build the calendar with React, using their existing API and integrating with their non-React web application. Besides, after some previous failed starts with less experienced developers, they were now looking for expertise in React, to get it done quickly and with a high quality result. The UI was relatively complex, with some requirements like loading thousands of days, hundreds of bookings, drag & drop...

I'm glad they found me! Web applications built with React are my comfort zone. I just love doing this. I've been doing it for years, and I stay up to date with all the news and trends. I know the ins and outs of building highly interactive complex interfaces in web applications. This was a perfect project for me.

Their feedback:

> It is a true pleasure to work with Guillermo, a magnificent professional, attentive, and willing... The truth is that working with him has been a real pleasure. We highly recommend him. Thank you very much!!
> Es un verdadero placer trabajar con Guillermo, un magnífico profesional, atento, dispuesto... la verdad que trabajar con él ha sido un verdadero placer. Lo recomendamos al 100%. Muchas gracias!!

Some interesting facts of the project:

- Developed and built using Vite
- Styling through Tailwind CSS. Due to its popularity, practically any other dev could pick it up in the future.
- TypeScript
- Native drag and drop for the booking cards.
- Start creating a new booking just by selecting the dates directly on the calendar.
- Engineered ways to use [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) to fetch and manage state for a calendar view that can be scrolled horizontally in both directions.
