Rossa is a management software product for hotels from a company based in Soria, Spain. For a while, their clients had been asking for a interactive calendar view to manage bookings across their rooms and properties, similar to the interface Airbnb offers with its advanced hosting controls.

I was hired via Malt ([check out my profile](https://www.malt.es/profile/guillermodelapuente)) to build the calendar with React, using their existing API and integrating with their non-React web application. They were looking for expertise in React, to get it done quickly and with a high quality result. The UI was relatively complex, with some requirements like loading thousands of days, lazy loading hundreds of bookings, drag & drop...

Web applications built with React are my comfort zone. I just love doing this. I've been doing it for years, and I know the ins and outs of building highly interactive complex interfaces in web applications. This was a perfect project for me.

After completing the project, here's their feedback:

> It is a true pleasure to work with Guillermo, a magnificent professional, attentive, and willing... The truth is that working with him has been a real pleasure. We highly recommend him. Thank you very much!!

> Es un verdadero placer trabajar con Guillermo, un magnífico profesional, atento, dispuesto... la verdad que trabajar con él ha sido un verdadero placer. Lo recomendamos al 100%. Muchas gracias!!

Some interesting facts of the project:

- Developed and built using Vite.
- For styling and building UI components, I used Tailwind CSS due to its popularity, thinking of other devs picking up the project in the future.
- TypeScript.
- [Native drag and drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/draggable) for the booking cards to change room and dates.
- Select dates directly on the calendar to start creating a new booking.
- Used [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) (React Query) in unconventional ways to fetch and manage paginated state for a calendar view that can be scrolled horizontally in both directions.
