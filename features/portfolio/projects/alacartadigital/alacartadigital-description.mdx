Developed during the first weeks of the pandemic, alacartadigital brought a
solution to restaurants that quickly needed to digitalize their menu and make
it accessible via QR codes. We needed to provide a super intuitive
interface, but customizable enough to solve various use cases and capable
of using the same branding as its restaurant.

Alongside [Cristian C](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristiancastillonavarro) and
[Kelvin S](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvin-sanchez), we built a Next.js application that
optimized **ease of use and page speed**. It included **brand customization of colors and typography with live preview**,
an integrated QR code generator, **paid subscriptions**, and enough
admin controls so that the founders wouldn't depend on developers to operate the platform.

The project has become a successful company powering hundreds of thousands of
menus in Spain and Latin America.
