After is an online memorials platform. Its frontend not only needs to be easy to use and fast,
but it needs to be smooth and delightful enough to evoke nostalgia and positive feelings.

I took on the project to **stabilize the product,** since at that time it had a lot of issues, and
to **increase user adoption.** Then, we moved on to **create revenue streams.**

- Fix all outstanding issues
- Improve the user experience and accessibility
- Simplify user flows to prevent users dropping off and boost sign-ups
- [Implement email nurture sequences to encourage users to come back with Sendinblue](/blog/how-to-set-up-sendinblue-tracker-in-react-typescript-app)
- Implement SEO good practices on all pages and monitor it via Google Search Console. [Check out how I implemented dynamic sitemap generation](/blog/how-to-make-dynamic-large-sitemaps-with-next-js-and-next-sitemap)
- Migrate the codebase to TypeScript to eliminate type issues and deliver more quickly with confidence
- Revive [their blog](https://blog.after.io/), giving it a fresh on-brand design and improving SEO to support the main site
- Take a deep dive into performance on mobile, making the [swiper](https://swiperjs.com/react) perform seamlessly even with complex memorial slides that have plenty of functionality
- Integrate [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to allow users to pay for memorial contributions and make donations
