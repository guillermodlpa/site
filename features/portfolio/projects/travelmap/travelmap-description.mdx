Travelmap was a pet project to learn **Auth0** for user authentication,
**Planetscale** as distributed database, **Mapbox** for map visualization and
interactions, and the UI component library **Grommet**.

The UI includes interesting effects made with SVG filters, and it includes light and dark mode.
