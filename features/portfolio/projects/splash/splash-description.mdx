As an all-in-one platform, Splash has built-in website editor for event
pages, form editor, tickets and registration platform, CRM,
integrations, email builder and sender for transactional and marketing,
and in-app integrations with virtual event providers.

During my years as software engineer and later as an engineering
manager, I worked in all kinds of projects and with many types of
technologies: frontend, backend, databases, queues, platform tooling, design
system... Through this experience, I learned
**the fundamentals and pitfalls of building SaaS platforms**
for enterprise users, and it shaped the way I approach projects to this
day.

My main contributions as an engineer were the stabilization and
evolution of the **website editor**, modernization of
frontend and backend codebases, implementation of the{" "}
**registration confirmations module**, implementation of
Splash's "growth machine" combining registrations and
sign-ups, and the implementation of tooling and processes for improving{" "}
**developer-experience**.
