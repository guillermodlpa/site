With 2 other non-technical cofounders, we built Quatro as a web application
for managing tasks and scheduling them. It included a **drag and drop** task list, **calendar display**, repeating tasks,
an **integration with Google Calendar**, **desktop notifications**, plenty of keyboard shortcuts,
and a **native desktop app** using [ToDesktop.](https://www.todesktop.com/)

During the project, I hired and briefly mananged 2 freelancers (we had a low budget, but I wanted some help to move quicker), worked with a brand designer to build the logo and website, and used its codebase to teach a friend how to code.

In the end, it didn't work out and we closed the project. One of my cofounders, Jon Saft, wrote a great
post with a lesson we learned: [What a B2B PM Learned About Building Consumer Products.](https://jonsaft.com/2022/02/04/what-a-b2b-pm-learned-about-building-consumer-products/)

The project is open sourced for others to learn from it. Youy can find it on [GitHub.](https://github.com/usequatro)
