Avocaty began as a freelance project I built in 2020 under the name [**alacartadigital**](/work/alacartadigital). A few years later, [Álvaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvaro-de-la-serna-fraile/) and [Jose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josemariadesantiago/) approached me with the idea of taking the platform to the next level, and I came on board as co-founder and CTO.

We rebranded as **Avocaty**, launched a company, and overhauled the product. We redesigned the entire editing experience, improved the visual design of digital menus, and added several features people had been asking for. These included **automatic translations** and the ability to digitize menus from photos using OpenAI's OCR capabilities.

We also spent time experimenting with different strategies to grow and improve the business:

- Improved onboarding flows to **increase conversion** from sign-up to published menu

- Tested multiple approaches to ad campaign performance and SEO

- Iterated on plan selection design and pricing page copy to drive upgrades

Later in 2023, we decided to expand into **Pay & Order** to increase revenue per customer. I started building an integration with **Ágora POS** through **Deliverect**, which turned out to be quite complex. It needed real-time, two-way sync, support for modifiers, and flexibility for different kinds of menu setups. We also added support for **LastApp**.

We were really excited about this new direction and started preparing [marketing materials and videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/C84vTyiIfjU/). But during early user testing, we ran into limitations with the integrations. Solving those issues would have required a lot more development time than we could handle with just me on the technical side.

So we decided to pause that direction and let the platform run in a more hands-off way. Since then, we’ve been keeping an eye on it, making small improvements and adjusting things month by month.

It’s a product I’m still proud of. Avocaty is a tool that helps hundreds of restaurants manage and update their digital menus with ease, and it taught me a lot about product development, experimentation, and scaling.
