In february, I teamed up with [Jaime Marco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimemarco/) and [Alejandro Celada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-celada-guerrero/) to build [**Abogali**](https://www.abogali.es/), a website builder originally aimed at law marketing agencies. We saw a real opportunity to simplify how these agencies made websites for their clients, which was painfully cumbersome and slow with WordPress. We worked on it in our spare time, just a few hours each week.

After a few months, we realized that our business expectations were far from being met. Alejandro left, and Jaime and I decided to pivot. We rebranded to **Marte** and turned it into a more general website builder for small and medium-sized businesses.

We kept working on it part-time and **brought in interns** to help. They contributed to internal tools, like a self-serve creation system and a tool for generating websites in bulk.

While Jaime focused on sales and customer relationships, I handled product development. We built Marte on top of [**TinaCMS, an open source headless CMS**](https://tina.io/). I used its schema and editing tools, and built all the visitor-facing interfaces, including reusable content **blocks** and **theming** options for designers. This project also gave me the chance to apply what I had learned while building [Splash's web CMS](https://www.splashthat.com/) a few years earlier.

The tech stack included Next.js, React, TypeScript, and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), with content stored in Git and accessed through a GraphQL API.

Working on Marte reminded me how much I enjoy building products at scale and leading engineering teams.
