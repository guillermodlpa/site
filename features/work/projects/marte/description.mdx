In february, I teamed up with [Jaime Marco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimemarco/) to build a website builder originally aimed at law marketing agencies. We saw a real opportunity to simplify how these agencies made websites for their clients, which was painfully cumbersome and slow with WordPress.

After a few months, we realized that our business expectations were far from being met. Jaime and I decided to pivot. We rebranded to **Marte** and turned it into a more general website builder for small and medium-sized businesses.

We kept working on it part-time and **brought in new team members** to help develop the product, streamline operations and design client websites. Marte grew in customers and exposure, we even were selected as [success case by EDIH](https://www.edihmadrid.es/casos_de_exito/kuuli-technologies/).

While Jaime focused on sales and customer relationships, I handled product development. We built Marte on top of [**TinaCMS, an open source headless CMS**](https://tina.io/). I used its schema and basic editing tools, and built on top of it all the visitor-facing interfaces, including reusable content **blocks** and **theming** options for designers, plus advanced editing tools integrated with the editor. This project also gave me the chance to apply so many things I had learned building [Splash's web CMS](https://www.splashthat.com/).

The tech stack included Next.js, React, TypeScript, and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), with content stored in Git and accessed through a GraphQL API.

Working on Marte reminded me how much I enjoy building products at scale and leading engineering teams. I also learned a lot about how to build a business, how to communicate with customers and how to work with a co-founder.
