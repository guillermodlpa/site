[DRAFT]

This is one of the most rewarding lessons I've learned in the last years.

Writing is thinking properly.
Writing is giving order and importance to the thoughts.
Writing is considering how to communicate information to others.
Writing well is hard.
Writing is the way to understand your own thoughts with clarity.
