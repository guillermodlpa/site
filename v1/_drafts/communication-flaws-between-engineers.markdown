During my past years of experience as a software engineer and engineering manager, I've come across repeatedly over a few communication imperfections among engineers. As a manger, I've coached my reports to polish them.

Lack of credibility due to not finishing sentences

## Upwards inflection at the end of sentences kills the credibility of our statements. There are two ways I've seen this happen:

1. Ending statements with upwards inflection. If we do it frequently, it might be a habit we've accidentally developed. It will take effort to become conscious about it to correct it, but it's doable. If we do it occasionally, it could be a non-conscious signal that we're actually not that sure of what we're stating. Upwards inflection isn't bad always, but it's bad when we're trying to make a credible statement.

2. Ending sentences with "yeah?", "right?" or "I guess?". It communicates that we're not confident about what we're saying and that we need validation from our listener. Sometimes that might be the case, the problem is when that's not the case. My recommendation when we're actually looking for validation is to ask "does that make sense to you?" and if we want to make sure they're actively listening, I recommend using "are you following me?".

## Not participating

Some don't get involved in conversations because they think they don't have much to offer. They might not even ask a question due to not wanting to stand out or slow down the rest of the team.

While this is a very normal reaction, I've seen this behavior result in undesirable outcomes, like people being eventually left out from conversations, people not being in sync and wrong assumptions due to those unasked questions.

The solution is a behavior change, which for more effectiveness, should be paired with encouragement by other team members to seek that everybody understands the conversation.

## Assuming others have knowledge and context on the topic

This is pretty frequent when speaking technically with non technical folks. I see this happening to all levels of engineers all the time. To be honest, for me, it's quite hard to have the active empathy to understand what's the current knowledge and context of those I'm speaking with.

Getting better at this requires practice. It also requires noticing it in others when they speak. In our teams, we encourage each other to stop us to clarify things. In terms of context, it's always good to start offering it, even if you think everybody already knows it, as it helps set up the foundation of the conversation.

## Lack of specificity, rambling

When we're unsure how to explain something, we tend to take a long time to describe it. Sometimes we start rambling. While others might not want to interrupt us for respect, it's a waste of time.

Best thing to do here is to ask for a moment of silence before answering. Breath deeply. Even if you don't find the words after that, it'll be more focused.

## Discussing complex ideas without help
